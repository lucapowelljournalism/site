          <p>Luca Powell is a reporter producing investigative features on issues of policing, immigration and public health.
            <br><br>
            Luca is also a strong data journalist with experience building interactives stories, 
            ranging from simple click-through storytelling to websites that tap APIs in real-time. 
            In November 2020, Luca contracted with the AP's election scraping
            team to pull in presidential vote totals from hundreds of county websites.
            <br><br>
            Luca is a recent graduate of the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism in New York City. As of 2021, he's freelancing stories in New York City and looking for a full-time reporting opportunity.
            <br><br>
            Luca is originally from New Haven, CT. He's a native Italian speaker and dual-citizen, and a very strong French speaker as well. Before J-school, Luca worked as an English
            teacher in Vietnam for several years, an experience which has greatly influenced his reporting so far.
