          <p>My name is Luca, and I'm a budding reporter producing investigative features on issues of policing, immigration and public health. More broadly, I get excited about finding new ways into citywide stories of the day. I've localized
            compelling public health stories to New York and captured underreported aspects of America's immigration system. Most often, editors and professors tell me I'm quite clear-eyed about my pitches, and that I've got a good nose for stories.
            <br><br>
            I'm also unafraid of using code to enhance my reporting. I've built interactives that range from simple click-through storytelling to websites that tap APIs in real-time. And in November, I contracted with the AP's election's scraping
            team to pull in results from hundreds of county websites. Database work has also been an integral part of a long-term investigation into the afterlives of NYPD officers, which I've been working on for several months under the guidance of
            Andrew Lehren.
            <br><br>

            I'm looking for a newsroom with editors that have some time to mentor younger reporters, and for a newsroom that's as excited as I am about finding more than way to tell a story. Most of my work so far has been in print, but I'm also a
            strong producer, which I owe to a demanding internship producing 'Live at Noon' at NY1.
            <br><br>

            About me! I'm originally from New Haven, CT. Thanks to a mother from Rome I'm a native Italian speaker, and thanks the Italian I'm a very strong French speaker as well. Before doubling-down on journalism, I worked as an English teacher in
            Vietnam for several years, an experience which has influenced a lot of my reporting so far.
