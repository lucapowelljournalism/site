          <p>Luca Powell is a reporter producing investigative features on issues of policing, immigration and public health. More broadly, I get excited about finding new ways into citywide stories of the day. I've localized
            compelling public health stories to New York and captured underreported aspects of America's immigration system.
            <br><br>
            Luca is also a strong data journalist with experience building interactives stories, ranging from simple click-through storytelling to websites that tap APIs in real-time, to scraping websites. In November, Luca contracted with the AP's
            election's scraping
            team to pull in presidential vote totals from hundreds of county websites in real time.
            <br><br>
            Luca is a recent graduate of the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism in New York City. As of 2021, he's freelancing stories in New York City and looking for full-time reporting work.
            <br><br>
            About me! I'm originally from New Haven, CT. I'm a native Italian speaker, and a very strong French speaker as well. Before J-school, I worked as an English
            teacher in Vietnam for several years, an experience which has influenced a lot of my reporting so far.
